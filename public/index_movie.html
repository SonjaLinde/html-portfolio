<h1>The Best K-Drama According To Sonya</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 K-drama's of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Crash Landing on You</h3>
<p>The idea of a South Korean heiress crash-landing in North Korea was fresh and daring. 
   It offered a rare and romanticized look into a forbidden, politically sensitive setting.<br />
   It seamlessly combined romance, comedy, action, and drama where<br />
   emotional moments were balanced with humor and suspense.</p> 

<h3>Descendents of the Sun</h3>
<p>The central love story between Captain Yoo Si-jin and Dr. Kang Mo-yeon was full of emotional tension, 
   charm, and mutual respect.<br />
   It tackled themes like duty vs. desire, sacrifice, and moral responsibility, creating emotional depth and raising the stakes of the romance.
</p>
<h3>When The Phone Rings</h3>
<p>The premiseâ€”where a woman fakes her own kidnapping to manipulate her emotionally distant husband
    was unconventional, suspenseful, and emotionally layered.<br>
    With moody cinematography, suspenseful pacing, and a haunting soundtrack, the drama
    had a thriller-meets-melodrama feel that stood out.</p>
