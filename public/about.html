<img src="../assets/images/SLinde2.jpg" alt="Sonja Linde Image" height="100" width="100">

<p>I am a dedicated professional with a foundation in economics, banking, finance, and information technology,
  currently focused on re-entering the IT development field as a full-stack developer. To achieve this,
  I am actively enhancing my technical skills through structured learning paths, including mastering HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, and exploring backend technologies such as Node.js and Java. My goal is to integrate modern
  development tools and frameworks to build comprehensive web applications.</p>

<p>I hold a B. Comm degree in Economics, Banking, and Finance with Information Technology from North-West
  University (formerly Potchefstroom University), completed in 1993. This academic background has provided me
  with a robust understanding of financial systems and technological applications, which I aim to leverage in
  my return to the IT sector.</p>

<p>My professional journey includes significant experience as an Information Analyst and Programmer at
  EDS South Africa, where I was involved in the maintenance, development, and implementation of business rules
  and lifecycle workflows using platforms such as Oracle PL/SQL and CICS/Cobol. Additionally, I served as an IT
  Developer at Sage Life, focusing on data processing applications. More recently, I have worked in administrative
  roles within the medical field, honing my skills in data management, client liaison, and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have developed a diverse skill set that includes the ability to work independently
  and collaboratively, effective client communication, analytical thinking, adaptability, and creativity.
  These competencies have been instrumental in my professional growth and are assets I bring to any team or project.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional endeavours, I have demonstrated leadership through various roles, such as serving on
  the leadership team for the Piet Retief Homeschool Group in 2020, leading an outreach project to France in
  collaboration with CEF in 2012, and participating in the Tubatse Ladies Committee in 2005. These experiences
  reflect my commitment to community engagement and organizational leadership.</p>

<p>In my personal time, I enjoy reading, watching K-dramas, attending theatre performances, strolling in
  nature, and listening to music. These hobbies not only provide relaxation but also inspire creativity and
  continuous learning, qualities that I bring into my professional life.</p>
